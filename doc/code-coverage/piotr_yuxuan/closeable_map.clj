?   "In your project, require:
  
? ``` clojure
? (require '[piotr-yuxuan.closeable-map :as closeable-map :refer [close-with with-tag]])
? ```
  
? Define an application that can be started, and closed.
  
? ``` clojure
? (defn start
?   \"Return a map describing a running application, and which values may
?   be closed.\"
?   [config]
?   (closeable-map/closeable-map
?     {;; Kafka producers/consumers are `java.io.Closeable`.
?      :producer (kafka-producer config)
?      :consumer (kafka-consumer config)}))
? ```
  
? You can start/stop the app in the repl with:
  
? ``` clojure
? (comment
?   (def config (load-config))
?   (def system (start config))
  
?   ;; Stop/close all processes/resources with:
?   (.close system)
?   )
? ```
  
? It can be used in conjunction with `with-open` in test file to create
? well-contained, independent tests:
  
? ``` clojure
? (with-open [{:keys [consumer] :as app} (start config)]
?   (testing \"unit test with isolated, repeatable context\"
?     (is (= :yay/🚀 (some-business/function consumer)))))
? ```
  
? You could also use thi library while live-coding to stop and restart
? your application whenever a file is changed.

✘      ;; stops the server, like:

? ```
  
? When `(.close system)` is executed, it will:
  
✘   - Recursively close all instances of `java.io.Closeable` and
?     `java.lang.AutoCloseable`;
?   - Recursively call all stop zero-argument functions tagged with
?     `^::closeable-map/fn`;
✔   - Skip all nested `Closeable` under a `^::closeable-map/ignore`;
✔   - Silently swallow any exception with `^::closeable-map/swallow`;
✔   - Exceptions to optional `::closeable-map/ex-handler` in key or
✔     metadata;
?   - If keys (or metadata) `::closeable-map/before-close` or
?     `::closeable-map/after-close` are present, they will be assumed as
?     a function which takes one argument (the map itself) and used run
?     additional closing logic:
  
?     ``` clojure
?     (closeable-map
?       {;; This function will be executed before the auto close.
?        ::closeable-map/before-close (fn [this-map] (flush!))
  
?        ;; Kafka producers/consumers are java.io.Closeable
?        :producer (kafka-producer config)
?        :consumer (kafka-consumer config)
  
?        ;; This function will be executed after the auto close.
?        ::closeable-map/after-close (fn [this-map] (garbage/collect!))})
✘     ```
  
? Some classes do not implement `java.lang.AutoCloseable` but present
? some similar method. For example instances of
? `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` can't be closed but they can be
? `.shutdown`:
  
? ``` clojure
? {:response-executor (close-with (memfn ^ExecutorService .shutdown)
?                       (flow/utilization-executor (:executor config)))
✘  :connection-pool (close-with (memfn ^IPool .shutdown)
✘                     (http/connection-pool {:pool-opts config}))}
✘ ```
  
? You may also extend this library by giving new dispatch values to
✘ multimethod [[piotr-yuxuan.closeable-map/close!]]. Once evaluated,
? this will work accross all your code. The multimethod is dispatched on
? the concrete class of its argument:
  
? ``` clojure
✘ (import '(java.util.concurrent ExecutorService))
✘ (defmethod closeable-map/close! ExecutorService
?   [x]
?   (.shutdown ^ExecutorService x))
  
? (import '(io.aleph.dirigiste IPool))
? (defmethod closeable-map/close! IPool
?   [x]
✘   (.shutdown ^IPool x))
? ```
  
? ## All or nothing
  
? ### No half-broken closeable map
  
? You may also avoid partially open state when an exception is thrown
? when creating a `CloseableMap`. This is where `closeable-map*` comes
✘ handy. It outcome in one of the following:
  
? - Either everything went right, and all inner forms wrapped by
?   `closeable` correctly return a value; you get an open instance of `CloseableMap`.
  
? - Either some inner form wrapped by `closeable` didn't return a
?   closeable object but threw an exception instead. Then all
?   `closeable` forms are closed, and finally the exception is
?   bubbled up.
  
✘ ``` clojure
? (closeable-map*
?   {:server (closeable* (http/start-server (api config)))
?    :kafka {:consumer (closeable* (kafka-consumer config))
✘            :producer (closeable* (kafka-producer config))
?            :schema.registry.url \"https://localhost\"}})
✘ ```
  
✘ ### No half-broken state in general code
  
✘ In some circumstances you may need to handle exception on the creation
? of a closeable map. If an exception happens during the creation of the
✘ map, values already evaluated will be closed. No closeable objects
? will be left open with no references to them.
  
? For instance, this form would throw an exception:
  
? ``` clojure
✘ (closeable-map/closeable-map {:server (http/start-server (api config))
?                               :kafka {:consumer (kafka-consumer config)
✘                                       :producer (throw (ex-info \"Exception\" {}))}})
? ;; => (ex-info \"Exception\" {})
✘ ```
  
? `with-closeable*` prevents that kind of broken, partially open states for its bindings:
  
✔ ``` clojure
? (with-closeable* [server (http/start-server (api config))
?                   consumer (kafka-consumer config)
?                   producer (throw (ex-info \"Exception\" {}))]
✘   ;; Your code goes here.
✘ )
✘ ;; Close consumer,
? ;; close server,
✘ ;; finally throw `(ex-info \"Exception\" {})`.
? ```
  
? You now have the guarantee that your code will only be executed if
? all these closeable are open. In the latter example an exception is
✘ thrown when `producer` is evaluated, so `consumer` is closed, then
? `server` is closed, and finally the exception is bubbled up. Your
✘ code is not evaluated. In the next example the body is evaluated,
? but throws an exception: all bindings are closed.
  
? ``` clojure
? (with-closeable* [server (http/start-server (api config))
?                   consumer (kafka-consumer config)
?                   producer (kafka-producer config)]
?   ;; Your code goes here.
?   (throw (ex-info \"Exception\" {})))
? ;; Close producer,
? ;; close consumer,
? ;; close server,
? ;; finally throw `(ex-info \"Exception\" {})`.
? ```
  
? When no exception is thrown, leave bindings open and return like a
? normal `let` form. If you prefer to close bindings, use `with-open` as
? usual.
?   
? ``` clojure
? (with-closeable* [server (http/start-server (api config))
?                   consumer (kafka-consumer config)
?                   producer (kafka-producer config)]
?   ;; Your code goes here.
?   )
? ;; All closeable in bindings stay open.
? ;; => result

?   You now have the guarantee that your code will only be executed if
?   all these closeable are open. In the latter example an exception is
?   thrown when `producer` is evaluated, so `consumer` is closed, then
?   `server` is closed, and finally the exception is bubbled up. Your
?   code is not evaluated. In the next example the body is evaluated,
?   but throws an exception: all bindings are closed.
  
?   ``` clojure
?   (with-closeable* [server (http/start-server (api config))
?                     consumer (kafka-consumer config)
?                     producer (kafka-producer config)]
?     ;; Your code goes here.
?     (throw (ex-info \"Exception\" {})))
?   ;; Close producer,
?   ;; close consumer,
?   ;; close server,
?   ;; finally throw `(ex-info \"Exception\" {})`.
?   ```
  
?   When no exception is thrown, leave bindings open and return like a
?   normal `let` form.
?   
?   ``` clojure
?   (with-closeable* [server (http/start-server (api config))
?                     consumer (kafka-consumer config)
?                     producer (kafka-producer config)]
?     ;; Your code goes here.
?     )
?   ;; All closeable in bindings stay open.
?   ;; => result
?   ```"

✔ (defmacro ^CloseableMap closeable-map*
?   "Avoid partially open state when an exception is thrown on evaluating
?   inner closeable forms wrapped by `closeable`.
  
?   ``` clojure
?   (closeable-map*
?     {:server (closeable* (http/start-server (api config)))
?      :kafka {:consumer (closeable* (kafka-consumer config))
?              :producer (closeable* (kafka-producer config))

?   ```
  
?   The outcome of this macro `closeable-map*` is one of the following:
  
?   - Either everything went right, and all inner forms wrapped by
?     `closeable` correctly return a value, then this macro returns an
?     open instance of `CloseableMap`.
  
?   - Either some inner form wrapped by `closeable` didn't return a
?     closeable object but threw an exception instead. Then all
?     `closeable` forms are closed, and finally the exception is
?     bubbled up.
  
?   Known (minor) issue: type hint is not acknowledged, you have to tag
?   it yourself with `^CloseableMap` (most precise),
?   `^java.io.Closeable`, or `^java.lang.AutoCloseable` (most generic)."
